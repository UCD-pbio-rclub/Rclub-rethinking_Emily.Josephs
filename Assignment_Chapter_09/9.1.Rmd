Do a Bayesian analysis of hypocotyl length (hyp) in the attached data sheet.

1) Consider treatment effects (trt) species effects (species) and their interaction.  What is the best model given these possible predictors?

-- I'm not sure how to deal with the categorical variables here.

2) Use "S. chmielewskii" as the reference.  For each of the other species evaluate the hypothesis that their response to shade differs from S. chmielewskii.




```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/Rclub-rethinking_Emily.Josephs/Assignment_Chapter_09")
d = read.csv('TomatoR2CSHL.csv', header=T)
d$trtNum = sapply(d$trt, function(x){if(x == 'H'){return(1)} else {return(-1)}})
d.trim = d[,c('trtNum','species','hyp')]
library(rethinking)

#m1 <- map2stan(
#  alist(
#    hyp~dnorm(mu,sigma),
#    mu <- a + bT*trtNum + bS*species + bTS*trtNum*species,
#    a ~ dnorm(10,10),
#    bT ~ dnorm(0,1),
#    bS ~ dnorm(0,1),
#    bTS ~ dnorm(0,1),
#    sigma ~ dcauchy(0,2)),
#  data=d.trim
#     )
