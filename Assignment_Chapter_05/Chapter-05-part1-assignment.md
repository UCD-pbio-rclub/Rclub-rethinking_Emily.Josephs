2 and 4 are multiple linear regressions I think (I'm not sure if an intercept is required)

## 5E2
Write down a multiple regression to evaluate the claim: Animal diversity is linearly related to latitude, but only after controlling for plant diversity. You just need to write down the model definition.

D<sub>a</sub> = animal diversity
D<sub>p</sub> = plant diversity
l = latitude

D<sub>i</sub> ~ Normal(μ, σ)
